**Pwnagotchi**: Deep Reinforcement Learning for WiFi Pwning.

_Pwnagotchi is an A2C-based “AI” powered by bettercap and running on a Raspberry Pi Zero W that learns from its surrounding WiFi environment in order to maximize the crackable WPA key material it captures \(either through passive sniffing or by performing deauthentication and association attacks\)_
